## Overview

### The Challenge
A biochemical pathways platform serves millions of researchers, educators, and students worldwide. The website needed a redesign to align with current branding standards while preserving its complex interactive features and scientific accuracy.

The existing platform was functional but outdated, with significant usability issues on mobile devices and inconsistencies with the client's current brand identity.

### My Role
I led the concept and interface design, working closely with UX researchers and program managers to create a modern, mobile-friendly experience that makes advanced biochemical information accessible and intuitive.

### The Outcome
We completely revamped the platform, integrating responsive design for seamless usability across desktop, tablets, and mobile devices. The mobile-first approach addressed critical usability gaps while maintaining the depth of scientific content users depend on.

## Context

### A Platform for Advanced Biochemical Insight

The Biochemical Pathways maps provide an interactive overview of cell chemical reactions across different species and organs. With a user base of millions worldwide spanning academia, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies, the platform serves as an essential resource for understanding complex biological systems.

**The Challenge:** Transform an outdated but mission-critical interface while maintaining scientific rigor and complex interactive functionality.

## Research & Discovery

### Understanding Users Through Direct Feedback

Following stakeholder interviews and comprehensive user research conducted by the team, I participated in **5 usability tests** to identify pain points in our redesign concepts.

#### Key Findings

**Mobile Experience Was Broken**
- "Using the map on the smartphone is difficult"
- Mobile navigation was particularly challenging for complex pathway exploration
- Zoom level controls were unintuitive

**Desktop Had Its Own Issues**
- "The overall menu/start was confusing"
- Users struggled to find the second map
- Toggle functionality under "Filter" didn't meet expectations

**What Users Valued**
- "Virtual should provide the same overview as the printed version"
- "Overview and connectivity of cycles is great"
- "Highlighting and labeling of area overlays is a strength"
- "It takes a while to get used to the structure of the map"

These insights revealed that users needed **quick access to comparison features**, **brand consistency for credibility**, and a careful **balance between information density and readability**.

## Design Approach

### Mobile-First, User-Centered Design

We prioritized the mobile experience, knowing that many users access the platform on various devices in lab settings. User feedback guided our selection of existing design system components and the development of new ones to address specific usability challenges.

**The Guiding Principle:** Balance aesthetic appeal with scientific rigor-create a clean, uncluttered interface that doesn't compromise on the depth of information users need.

### Working Within the Design System

We leveraged the client's existing design system components while developing new ones as needed. This approach ensured:
- **Brand consistency** across the company's digital products
- **Faster development** through reusable components
- **Professional polish** that builds user trust

We documented comprehensive specifications covering user flows, component behavior, and functionality details-critical for a platform this complex.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Mobile-First Navigation Redesign

**The Problem:** The existing navigation was overwhelming on small screens, making pathway exploration frustrating.

**The Solution:** We created a streamlined bottom navigation with clear hierarchy:
- **Overview → Focus → Filter** flow that guides users naturally
- Large, thumb-friendly touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Collapsible panels to maximize map viewing space
- Clear visual indicators for active states

### 2. Improved Search & Filter Experience

**The Problem:** Users couldn't find specific pathways efficiently, especially on mobile.

**The Solution:**
- Prominent search bar with autocomplete
- Redesigned filter system with clear categories (Enzymes, Substrates/Products, Compounds)
- Search results with context ("Show 114 matches in Cellular and Molecular Processes")
- Legend panel for understanding map notation

### 3. Enhanced Focus & Overlay Tools

**The Problem:** Users valued the ability to focus on specific pathways but found the controls confusing.

**The Solution:**
- **Focus tooltip** with clear descriptions of pathway functions
- **Overlay cards** for detailed vs. schematic views
- **Drawing tools** for annotations (future enhancement)
- Information architecture that reveals complexity progressively

## Solution

### Desktop Experience

Our design balances **aesthetics and usability**. We strove for **simple and clear navigation**, knowing it improves user engagement.

**Key Features:**
- Tab-based navigation (Metabolic Pathways / Cellular and Molecular Processes)
- Persistent search and filter controls
- Overview, Focus, and Filter modes accessible at all times
- Clean visual hierarchy that guides users through dense scientific content
- Zoom controls optimized for precision work

### Mobile Experience

We delivered a **mobile-first design** that provides an intuitive user experience for exploring complex pathways:

**Homepage**
- Clear entry point with pathway selection
- Simplified menu structure
- Quick access to frequently used features

**Onboarding**
- First-time user guidance
- "Skip Guide" option for returning users
- Contextual tooltips explaining new features

**Map Interaction**
- Optimized pinch-to-zoom
- Bottom sheet navigation for easy thumb reach
- Full-screen map mode
- Smooth transitions between overview and detail views

## Implementation & Handover

### Ensuring Seamless Development

We documented comprehensive specifications covering:
- User flows for all primary and secondary tasks
- Component behavior and states
- Interactive feature requirements
- Responsive breakpoints and adaptations

These specifications were thoroughly explained in the final meeting with the client's development team to ensure accurate implementation.

**Legacy Impact:** The design system components we developed have been integrated into the client's broader design system for use in future projects.

## Impact & Reflections

### What I Took Away

**1. Balancing Domain Expertise with Usability**
Scientific accuracy couldn't be compromised for simplicity. The key was making complexity *manageable*, not hiding it. This taught me to deeply understand user needs within highly specialized domains.

**2. Mobile-First Is Essential, Even for "Professional" Platforms**
Initial assumptions suggested desktop would be primary, but research showed mobile usage was critical. This reinforced the importance of data-driven design decisions over assumptions.

**3. Design Systems Enable Creativity Within Constraints**
Working within an existing design system didn't limit creativity-it provided a foundation for solving new problems efficiently while ensuring consistency.

**4. Documentation Is As Important As Design**
For complex interactive features, thorough documentation and developer collaboration were critical. Beautiful designs fail if they can't be implemented accurately.

### Measurable Outcomes

- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Improved usability** validated through testing
- **Brand alignment** with client's design system
- **Scalable components** integrated into company-wide design system
- **Millions of users** worldwide benefit from improved accessibility
